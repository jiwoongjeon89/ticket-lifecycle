<h3>Scenario #1: Entire mobile/online banking system is down </h3>

<p>

</p>
<p>
First, we need to open a new ticket from the End-User osTicket website.  
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
I have logged in as John and as you can see, John can see the ticket created by Karen. 
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
When you click on the ticket, you can configure things like priority, department, SLA and assign the ticket to others according to the permissions you have as an Agent. 
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
The entire banking system being down is a very serious problem. Therefore, John will set the priority as Emergency. 
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Also, John will set the SLA plan to the Sev-A in the same sense.  
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Karen made the ticket’s Help Topic to ‘Report a Problem’ but as an Agent, John can change the Help Topic to a more specific one: Business Critical Outage.
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
As this is an online banking problem, John will assign the ticket to the Online Banking Team. Because John assigned the ticket to the online banking team, John will not be able to see or change the ticket anymore.  
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
So, I will log in as Jane, who is in the online banking team and assign the ticket to Jane. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Then, Jane will reply to Karen about the situation. Giving her as much information as possible to reassure the custumer.
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
When the problem is resolved, Jane will report it to Karen and close out the ticket. 
</p>
<br />

<h3>Scenario #2: Accounting department needs adobe upgrade, broken </h3>

<p>

</p>
<p>
We will open this ticket as the User Ken. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://imgur.com/peZMQIV.png"/>
</p>
<p>
I have logged in as John to resolve the ticket. 
</p>
<p>
  John will assign the SLA to Sev-B for now and try to talk to Ken for more information about the situation. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://imgur.com/Fj5Eohl.png"/>
</p>
<p>
John will take this ticket. So, he will assign the ticket to himself. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://imgur.com/7NM0p1w.png"/>
</p>
<p>
John will ask more information about the situation to Ken through the Post Reply box. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://imgur.com/9kDhQ70.png"/>
</p>
<p>
After receiving more information about the situation. John decided to lower the SLA plan to a Sev-C. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://imgur.com/MiYCoFj.png"/>
</p>
<p>
John will write more information about this ticket on the forum. This helps not only John but the entire team to keep track of what has been happening.
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
John got the message from Ken that restarting the computers fixed the problem and he will now close the ticket.  
</p>
<br />
